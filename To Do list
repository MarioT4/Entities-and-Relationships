I want to make a To DO list using elements from javascript, css, and HTML to have a coherent user friendly expierence.
I would want it to be able to push notifactions of some kind on a daily basis.
I would want boxes associated with tasks that I could check off and visually see a difference between completed and incomplete task
I would want a way to insert new tasks whenever I would want.
